# decentralized-charity

The Decentralized Charity Platform allows charities to raise a fund that gives benefactors the opportunity to play an active part in making sure the charity is accountable to their goals. 

## How it works: 

The charity raises a fund and sets a series of milestones that they promise to accomplish over the lifetime of the fund. The milestones segment the fund into installments, with each installment being paid out upon the donors voting that the charity has effectively met their milestone.

##User Roles:





The charity then periodically proposes a set of initiatives that the benefactors vote on, with each vote weighted based on the benefactor’s equity in the fund. 



When donors donate to the fund, their donation is locked up in a smart contract.The initiative that gets the most equity weighted votes will trigger the smart contract to release the necessary funds to the charity allowing them to focus on the project as their next initiative. If the majority votes to fund none of the proposed initiatives, the funds will not be released from the smart contract, prompting the charity to propose a new set of initiatives. The goal of the platform is to both allow benefactors to play a more active role in determining the allocation of their donations as well as incentivize charities to pursue high quality and cost effective initiatives.
