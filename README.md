# decentralized-charity

The Decentralized Charity Platform allows charities to raise a fund that gives benefactors the opportunity to play an active part in making sure the charity is accountable to their goals.

## How it works:

The charity raises a fund and sets a series of milestones that they promise to accomplish over the lifetime of the fund. The milestones segment the fund into installments, with each installment being paid out upon the donors voting that the charity has effectively met their milestone.

## User Roles:

### Fund Manager:
The fund manager is the creator of the fund. The fund manager has the following permissions:
**Add a milestone to the fund:**
**Deploy the fund:** to open it up for donations,
**Activate the fund:**
**Move to next milestone:**

### Donor:
The donor is a contributor to the fund. A donor has the following permissions:
**Donate to the fund:**
**Claim funds:**

## Technical Details

This project was building using Next.js, React, Semantic-ui.

## Pre-requisitions

Node ([https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)) <br>
Yarn ([https://yarnpkg.com](https://yarnpkg.com)) or NPM<br>
Truffle (`yarn global add truffle`) <br>
Ganache-CLI (`yarn global add ganache-cli`) <br>

Application is built with React and Truffle framework.


## Running the Application in Development

### Start the Ethereum RPC Client
```
ganache-cli
```
The default port number for Ganache is `8545`

### Configure the Application

Check on the file `truffle.js`. Make sure that the port number matches the one that Ganache uses (or other RPC client port number).
```
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 8545,
      network_id: "*" // Match any network id
    }
  }
};
```

### Run Tests for the Contract
```
truffle test
```

### Install the Dependencies
```
npm install
truffle install
truffle compile
```

### Deploy the Contract
```
truffle migrate
```

### Start the Application
```
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000.


## Deploying to Production

### Install the Dependencies
```
npm install
truffle install
truffle compile
```

### Deploy the Contract
The application uses [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) to manage environmental variables. Create a `.env` file with values for the following environment variables.
```
REACT_APP_INFURA_API_KEY=
REACT_APP_WALLET_MNEMONIC=
```
Then deploy the contract to the network (`rinkeby`).
```
truffle migrate --network rinkeby
```
Note the deployed address of the contract for usage in the next step

### Build for Production

Set the deployed address (from the previous step) environment variable in the production server.
```
REACT_APP_DEPLOYED_ADDRESS=
```

Then build the application with webpack.
```
yarn build
```
A minified bundle `build_webpack` will be created. Simply serve this folder.


## Feature and Issue Tracking

All user stories (features) and issues are tracked and managed in this [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/7UhQQrn0).


## Notes

### Account Switching with MetaMask

The User Interface does not refresh automatically when you switch between accounts with MetaMask. To maintain display consistency, do refresh the browser every time when you switch an account with MetaMask.

### Slow Network Speed

It takes a while to get a response from the network, hence the user interface feedback might be slow. Please be patient and wait for the network to response.

### EthPM Packages
Packages in EthPM are outdated. Zeppelin is added to this codebase via EthPM due to specific requirements. It is advised to add this dependency module through Yarn instead.











The charity then periodically proposes a set of initiatives that the benefactors vote on, with each vote weighted based on the benefactorâ€™s equity in the fund.
