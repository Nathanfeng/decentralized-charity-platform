Hi There,<br>

Thanks for grading my project! I just wanted to give you a heads up that though although most of the front end of the application built, I didn't have time to connect all the elements of the front end to the smart contracts. Creating a new fund and adding milestones should work, including the signing with MetaMask. I just haven't displayed the all the state changes yet.<br>

All the smart contracts were tested both through remix and through the javascript tests so the contract should be ok.<br>

Feel free to email me know if you have any questions at nathanlfeng@gmail.com<br>

Cheers!
