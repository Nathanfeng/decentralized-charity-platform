Hi There,<br>

Thanks for grading my project! I just wanted to give you a heads up that though although the front end of the application is built, I haven't connected all the elements of the front end to the smart contracts yet. Some elements are hooked up like creating a new fund and adding milestones, including the signing with MetaMask. I just haven't displayed the all the state changes yet on the front end.<br>

All the smart contracts were tested thoroughly both through remix and through the javascript tests so the contract should be ok.<br>

Feel free to email me know if you have any questions at nathanlfeng@gmail.com<br>

Cheers!
